# Epistemic Foundation 
_Conditions of Possibility_

### Structure of an Argument
To argue is to say, “I think this is true, and here is why.” An argument is a conclusion (the claim) supported by reasons. A clear structure helps track that support by starting from common ground, defining key terms, setting the scope of the claim, and stating any assumptions. The line of reasoning is offered for the audience to judge.

### Mind is the Basis of Knowledge
We learn about the world by paying attention. We receive sensations—seeing a ball, hearing a dog, feeling cold—and the mind organizes them in time (“first… then…”) and space (“here… there…”). This organization allows us to identify stable objects and events. We also use this structure to find regularities: counting patterns and cause-and-effect relations like “I drop it, it falls.” We engage in inquiry when we ask questions and test ideas; what we eventually settle on becomes empirical knowledge.[^1]

### The Action Axiom
Action is purposeful—you choose among options to reach goals you prefer. Because resources are scarce (there is only one of you), every choice involves tradeoffs that unfold over time. Facing an uncertain future, you rely on judgment to speculate about what will best satisfy your wants. Social science begins by treating behavior as meaningful, relating the chosen means with ends and beliefs. This incentive-based understanding of human action is the foundation of all inquiry.[^2]

### The Argument Axiom
When you choose argument over other methods, you commit to a collaborative method of inquiry. You put your arguments on the table for assessment, and treat feedback as worth taking seriously. You also take on an ethic of non-contradiction—your reasoning is constrained by coherence, so your claims must agree with one another.[^3] These norms create the conditions for a discourse in which ideas can be judged as better or worse justified—and, where appropriate, as true or false—and in which argument becomes a shared practice of learning.
