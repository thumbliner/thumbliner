## X Axis

### Baby
Cries, gets fed. Next time, cries sooner—and louder.

### Driver
Steers and brakes, feels the jerk, keeps adjusting until it’s right. Inconsistent braking muddies the cause-and-effect—it adds noise to the feedback.

### Shopper
Makes a purchase, waits for delivery, tries it out, then updates buying behavior for next time. When feedback arrives late, learning slows—so one lean on shortcuts like "trust this brand."

### Politician
Chooses a message, delivers it, watches the room and the polls, then adjusts. The public is the sensor. Their reaction is the feedback signal.

### Entrepreneur
Places a bet on what the shopper will purchase, then risks scarce time and capital to produce it. Profit and loss provide feedback.

### Student
Builds a model, tries to solve a problem, fails, updates the model. Learning happens when the error stings.

### Plain
Notice what’s happening. Pick a move. Do it. See what happens. Adapt.

### Practical
Take in information, form a view, choose an action, then compare the result to what you expected. Use the gap to update expectations and tune habits.

### Formal
An agent senses its environment and models a state estimate. It predicts consequences and selects an action. After acting, it compares outcomes to expectations; the resulting error updates its policy.

### Elvish
Cognition is closed-loop information processing. An agent samples partial evidence and receives compact signals that summarize constraints and affordances. From these, it infers a latent state and constructs causal representations of its environment. Using a dynamic model, it generates probabilistic expectations, then applies judgment to select feasible, norm-compliant control actions within limits of capability, budget, and risk policy. Action perturbs the evidentiary stream, so perception, belief, prediction, and control form a feedback loop. After acting, the agent re-observes, measures prediction error as divergence between expected and realized outcomes, and traces the error to perception, world-model, value/utility components, and execution. It then updates the model and policy to improve performance under scarcity and uncertainty.

### Math
At time $$t$$, each agent $$i$$ receives a local observation $$o_t^i$$ (including relevant price signals $$p_t$$) and infers an interpretation $$s_t^i = \phi_{\theta_i}!\left(o_{\le t}^i,; p_{\le t}\right)$$. The agent selects an action via a policy $$a_t^i = \mu_{\psi_i}!\left(s_t^i\right)$$ (subject to constraints). After executing $$a_t^i$$, it receives new observations $$o_{t+1}^i$$ (including updated prices $$p_{t+1}$$) and infers $$s_{t+1}^i = \phi_{\theta_i}!\left(o_{\le t+1}^i,; p_{\le t+1}\right)$$. It computes discrepancy/feedback signals, e.g., an interpretive/model (one-step prediction) error $$e_t^i = s_{t+1}^i - f_{\omega_i}!\left(s_t^i,; a_t^i\right)$$ and profit/loss $$\pi_{t+1}^i = \mathrm{rev}*{t+1}^i - \mathrm{cost}*{t+1}^i$$ (optionally $$\delta_t^i = \pi_{t+1}^i - \mathbb{E}*t!\left[\pi*{t+1}^i\right]$$), and uses these signals to update parameters $$(\theta_i,\psi_i,\omega_i)$$.

### Applied Epistemology
The practice of building models of the world and staying alert for special situations when something jumps out at you. You can test your beliefs if you accept the outcome as a grade on your problem-solving method. It is substance for inquiry. Learning becomes a game when your judgment carries the burden of uncertainty fr.

> “I have a habit (some might call it a compulsion) of analyzing how things work, examining their effects on people, and parsing out which elements are fundamentally compelling and which are just window dressing. Once you isolate the most interesting part of any given decision, then you’re ready to build an interactive experience for the player that feels fascinatingly new, yet comfortingly familiar. That’s my philosophy, anyway. It seems to have worked out pretty well.”<br>
