### The Standard
- “If I can’t explain it clearly, I don’t understand it well enough myself.”
- “Criticize all you want. You will never be more critical of me than I am of myself.”
- “I demand a lot because I give a lot. If you don’t want to meet my standards, you’re free to leave.”

---

> “We defend by having the ball. That's our first line of defense.”<br>
> — Pep Guardiola

---

### The Learning
- “Understanding comes from repetition.”
- “Our job is to convince the players that our way is the best way to cross the road.”
- “I want players who are curious, who ask questions, who want to understand why we do things.”

> “The one who has the ball commands the game. The one who doesn't have it runs.”<br>
> — Pep Guardiola

---

### The Attitude
- “If we don’t win, it’s my fault.”
- “You have to learn to play football with courage.”
- “Losing hurts. If it doesn't hurt, you're in the wrong profession.”

> “In football, the worst thing you can do is lose the ball. We have to keep it at all times.”<br>
> — Pep Guardiola

---

### The Process
- “I don’t worry about what others do. I focus on what we can control.”
- “The goal is the consequence of the process. If the process is good, the goals will come.”
- “The game is about space and time. That's all. How you use space, how you manage time.”
